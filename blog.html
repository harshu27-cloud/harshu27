        <p class="short-text">
          Understand how Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing helps identify
          real-world security gaps before attackers do.
        </p>

        <p class="full-text" style="display:none;">
          VAPT simulates real-world cyber attacks on web applications, APIs, networks,
          and cloud systems. It helps organizations understand their actual security posture,
          prioritize risks using CVSS scoring, and apply remediation strategies before
          real attackers exploit these vulnerabilities.

    <h3>Inside a Modern Security Operations Center (SOC)</h3>

    <p class="short-text">
      Explore how SOC teams detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats in real time
      using SIEM, SOAR, and EDR platforms.
    </p>

    <p class="full-text" style="display:none;">
      A modern Security Operations Center (SOC) is the core of an organization’s cyber 
      defense strategy. It continuously monitors logs, network traffic, endpoints, 
      cloud workloads, and user activities to detect suspicious behavior.<br><br>

      SOC analysts use SIEM platforms like Splunk or ELK to correlate events, reduce 
      false positives, and prioritize high-risk alerts. Advanced SOCs integrate EDR, 
      NDR, and SOAR tools to automate incident response, isolate infected systems, 
      block malicious IPs, and contain breaches in real time.<br><br>

      The primary goal of a SOC is to ensure business continuity by detecting threats 
      early, minimizing impact, and providing forensic reports for management and 
      compliance requirements.

    <h3>Digital Forensics & Incident Response Explained</h3>

    <p class="short-text">
      Learn how DFIR helps investigate breaches, analyze malware, and collect
      digital evidence for legal and security purposes.
    </p>

    <p class="full-text" style="display:none;">
      Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) focuses on identifying, 
      investigating, and responding to cybersecurity incidents. When a breach 
      occurs, DFIR specialists collect digital evidence from servers, endpoints, 
      network devices, and cloud platforms to reconstruct the attack timeline.<br><br>

      Forensic analysts use tools such as Volatility, Autopsy, FTK Imager, and 
      Wireshark to analyze memory dumps, disk images, logs, and network traffic. 
      This helps determine attacker techniques, persistence mechanisms, and 
      compromised assets.<br><br>

      Incident Response teams then work to contain the threat, remove malicious 
      artifacts, restore systems, and provide forensic reports that support legal 
      action, compliance audits, and long-term security improvements.

    <h3>Cloud Security Best Practices for Enterprises</h3>

    <p class="short-text">
      A practical guide to securing AWS and Azure environments with IAM,
      logging, monitoring, and zero-trust architecture.
    </p>

    <p class="full-text" style="display:none;">
      Cloud security focuses on protecting cloud-based workloads, data, and 
      infrastructure from modern cyber threats. It involves implementing strong 
      Identity and Access Management (IAM), network segmentation, encryption, 
      and continuous monitoring across cloud environments.<br><br>

      Security teams use native cloud tools such as AWS Security Hub, Azure 
      Defender, and Google Security Command Center to detect misconfigurations, 
      monitor suspicious activity, and enforce compliance policies. Zero-trust 
      architecture ensures that every user, device, and workload is verified 
      before access is granted.<br><br>

      Effective cloud security helps organizations prevent data breaches, 
      maintain regulatory compliance, and ensure high availability of 
      mission-critical cloud services.
